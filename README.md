# Simple-Spacetime-Crawler
Spacetime crawler created using Python. Crawls through web page, extracting the content, and if there is a valid link, crawls through the next link. Keeps statistics on domain visited and most out links.

Not uploaded is raw webpage content to look through. Dict.json is book keeping for the links.
